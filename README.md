# TPGA UI (Angular) Assignment

## TOTAL DURATION: 4 Hours

<br />

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN, READ THIS**
- Create an Angular Project using NPM and Angular CLI.
- You may use any open source libraries via NPM that aid quicker development.
- Ensure that your code is written in TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
- Once completed, ensure that you run the build to generate the Javascript code.
- Ensure you do not check in the node modules folder

#### SECTION 1 - **Duration 40 Minutes** <br />
Create a Login page. This should be the default view. Feel free to design it the way you like it and apply your own theme. Add Form validations to the Login screen.

<br />


#### SECTION 2 - **Duration 1 Hour** <br />
Create a Home page. On valid Login submit, the user should be redirected to this page. This page should have a navigation bar with two tabs; "Home" and "Graph".<br />
The "Home" tab should contain a DataGrid that loads data via a HTTP call. You can use any public API (example: https://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/role?current=true&role_type=representative&limit=438) or visit this page (https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets#government) for other sample APIs. If time permits, feel free to add features like column sorting, search, pagination, etc.<br />
*Note: You do not need to show all the data in separate columns. It is up to you to decide which columns should be displayed.*

<br />


#### SECTION 3 - **Duration 1 Hour** <br />
In the grid, each of the rows should have an edit button. <br />
On click, a dialog popup should open that lists all the grid columns in a Form in edit mode along with a "Ok" button. You can decide to choose the input form elements based on the type of data the column has. 
<br />On clicking "Ok", the changes made should be reflected in the grid row. 

<br />


#### SECTION 4 - **Duration 1 Hour, 20 Minutes** <br />
In the "Graph" tab, use the same grid data or any data in the link provided above to create a dashboard of multiple chart widgets. 
<br />This is where you take the liberty to make your own layout and decide what charts should be depicted. 
<br />You can decide any open source chart library / libraries you wish to use. 
<br />Ensure there are at least 3 chart widgets. This (https://coderthemes.com/minton/boxed-hori/index.html), is an example of what we are looking for.
